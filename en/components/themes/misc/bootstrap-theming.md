# Bootstrap Theming
<p class="highlight">The Ignite UI for Angular theming engine provides an opportunity to be used in conjunction with other component libraries such as the popular [`NG Bootstrap`](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/) based on Bootstrapâ€™s markup and CSS.</p>
<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Overview

The Ignite UI for Angular is a complete set of Material-based UI Widgets, Components & Sketch UI kits and supporting directives for Angular that enables developers to build modern high-performance apps. Our theming engine is easy to use and allows theming granularity on different levels from a single component, multiple components, or the entire suite. Therefore, some users want to take advantage of it not only with Ignite UI components but also with other libraries. In this article, we will look through the usage of Ignite UI together with Ng Bootstrap components.

## Demo

<code-view style="height: 1000px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/theming/bootstrap-sample" >
</code-view>

## Basic Usage

### Add NG Bootstrap

If you are using Angular CLI and have an existing Angular project, you can install NG Bootstrap with the command below: 

```cmd 
ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
```

Once installed, you have to import the NG Bootstrap main module into your *app.module.ts* file: 

```ts
import {NgbModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        ...,
        NgbModule,
        ...
    ]
)}
```

At this point your applications is ready to use the NG Bootstrap components. You can find more information about using Bootstrap library at their [`official documentation`](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/getting-started).

### Add Ignite UI for Angular 

To install the Ignite UI for Angular package, along with all of its dependencies, font imports and styles references to your project, run the following command: 

```cmd
ng add igniteui-angular
```

Then, you can use the Ignite UI components by importing their respective modules in your *app.module.ts* file:

```ts
// manually addition of the Igx Avatar component 
import { IgxAvatarModule } from 'igniteui-angular';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        ...,
        IgxAvatarModule,
        ...
    ]
)}
```

Follow our [`Getting Started`](../../general/getting-started.md) topic for a complete introduction about using Ignite UI for Angular in existing projects. Further information on how to import and use each of our components along with guided examples can be found in the component's documentation.

## Components

Let's see how our demo sample is done. It is a mixture of Ignite UI and NG Bootstrap components, styled to fit nicely in one application. The navigation in our example is created using the bootstrap `navbar` together with igx `buttons` and `avatar`. The `dropdown` under the Campaigns button is also taken from the bootstrap library. Below the nav, we are using the `igx-card` component to display some statistics. Within the cards, we have placed multiple items - igx `avatars` and `icons` as well as bootstrap `buttons` and `ngb-ratings`. 

<img src="../../../images/igx-cards.png" width="100%">

Clicking on the `More` buttons, you will see the `igx-dialog`:

<img src="../../../images/igx-dialog.png" width="100%">

Next, we have added an `ngb-accordion` showing information about credit cards. Inside its content, there is an `igx-list` and `igx-button`.

<img src="../../../images/ngb-accordion.png" width="100%">

Finally, we inserted an igx `icon button` in the top right corner, that changes the color palette for the whole app: 

<img src="../../../images/dark-variant.png" width="100%">

## Styling

To get started with styling components using the Ignite UI theming engine, create an scss file named of your choice that would be the base file for your global theme. We will call this file `_variables.scss`. Next, we need to import the `index` file, where all the theme functions and component mixins live: 

```scss
// _variables.scss

@import '~igniteui-angular/lib/core/styles/themes/index';
``` 

### Colors

The Bootstrap library makes use of a sass map called `$theme-colors` to provide a palette composed of eight colors:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
    "primary":    $primary,
    "secondary":  $secondary,
    "success":    $success,
    "info":       $info,
    "warning":    $warning,
    "danger":     $danger,
    "light":      $light,
    "dark":       $dark
);
```

On the other hand, the Ignite UI `igx-palette` function generates a color palette map including `primary`, `secondary`, `grays`, `info`, `success`, `warn`, and `error` colors and their 74 color variants. Our predefined bootstrap palette in turn consists of seven colors: 

```scss
$bootstrap-palette: igx-palette(
    $primary: #007bff,
    $secondary: #6c757d,
    $info: #17a2b8,
    $success: #28a745,
    $warn: #ffc107,
    $error: #dc3545,
    $surface: #f8f9fa
);
```

As you can see most of the colors in their palette overlap the colors in the palettes of Ignite UI. Thus, we can simply map the Bootstrap theme colors with our light or dark bootstrap palette colors. 

First, we are going to define Sass variables for the `$light-bootstrap-palette` colors:

```scss
// Colors from the Ignite UI light bootstrap color palette
$light-primary: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "primary");
$light-secondary: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "secondary");
$light-success: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "success");
$light-info: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "info");
$light-warning: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "warn");
$light-danger: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "error");
```

After that, we will create a new color palette which will be used for the dark mode of the sample:

```scss
// Defining custom color palette
$custom-dark-palette: igx-palette(
    $primary: #ecaa53,
    $secondary: #011627,
    $grays: #fff,
    $surface: #222
);

// Creating Sass variables for its primary and secondary colors
$dark-primary: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, "primary");
$dark-secondary: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, "secondary");
```

>Visit our [`palettes with sass`](../sass/palettes.md) section to discover more about the palettes provided by Ignite UI for Angular and learn how to create a new one.

### Color mode

In order to switch between `light` and `dark` mode, we are adding a custom class to the `host` element which will be changed on button click event. In our stylesheet file, we are going to include different color palettes according to that class.

#### Light mode

The Ignite UI for Angular comes in with a predefined theme inspired by [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) library. To use it, first, you have to include our `igx-core` mixin and then our built-in theme mixin - [igx-bootstrap-light-theme]({environment:sassApiUrl}/index.html#mixin-igx-bootstrap-light-theme). We will also make use of our predefined bootstrap palette - [$light-bootstrap-palette]({environment:sassApiUrl}/index.html#variable-light-bootstrap-palette). 

The background color for our application needs to be set explicitly on the host element. In our sample, we want to use the `surface` color of the passed palette.

Along with including the themes, at this point, we have to modify the bootstrap `$theme-colors` map with our sass variables created earlier.
Lastly, we need to import the bootstrap library - *always import it at the end!*

```scss
// Make sure you always include the igx-core mixin first
@include igx-core();

:host {
    &.light {
        // The background color of the application in light mode
        background: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, 'surface');

        ::ng-deep {
            // Applying the igx predefined light bootstrap palette and theme
            @include igx-bootstrap-light-theme($light-bootstrap-palette);

            $theme-colors: (
                "primary": $light-primary,
                "secondary": $light-secondary,
                "success": $light-success,
                "info": $light-info,
                "warning": $light-warning,
                "danger": $light-danger
            );

            // Importing Bootstrap SCSS file
            // Make sure you always import it last
            @import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
        }
    }
}
```

The `light` and `dark` colors from the `$theme-colors` map, which don't have corresponding values in the Ignite UI palettes, can also be replaced with values at our discretion. For instance: 

```scss
$custom-light: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "grays", 100);
$custom-dark: igx-color($light-bootstrap-palette, "grays", 800);

:host {
    &.light {
        ::ng-deep {
            $theme-colors: (
                "light": $custom-light,
                "dark": $custom-dark,
            );
        }
    }
}
```

#### Dark mode

For our dark variant of the application we are going to use our newly created `$custom-dark-palette` so we have to include it in the `dark class` styles and also modify the `$theme-colors` map with the new values. 

All the colors in the Ignite UI components come from the passed palette, therefore they fit nicely in the dark mode without any additional adjustments. However, we have to do some more styling changes for the ng-bootstrap components: 

```scss
:host {
    &.dark {
        // The background color of the application in dark mode
        background: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'surface');

        ::ng-deep {
            // Applying our custom dark palette 
            @include igx-bootstrap-dark-theme($custom-dark-palette);

            // Overriding ngb-accordion colors with colors from the custom dark palette
            .accordion {
                .card-header {
                    background-color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'grays', 200);
                    color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'grays', 900);
                }

                .card {
                    background-color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'surface');
                    border-color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'grays', 300);
                }
            }

            // Overriding bootstrap dropdown colors with colors from the custom dark palette
            .dropdown .dropdown-menu {
                background-color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'surface');
                border-color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'grays', 300);

                .dropdown-item {
                    color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'grays', 800);

                    &:hover {
                        background-color: igx-color($custom-dark-palette, 'grays', 200);
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Modifying the bootstrap color map
            $theme-colors: (
                "primary": $dark-primary,
                "secondary": $dark-secondary
            );

            // Importing Bootstrap SCSS file
            @import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
        }
    }
}
```

Once we are done with modifying the `$theme-colors` map, the bootstrap components will already use the colors from the igx `$light-bootstrap-palette` for the light mode, and `$custom-dark-palette` for the dark one.

### Typography

Ignite UI exposes `type-scale` and `typeface` variables for each of its themes, which can be used inside the `igx-typography` mixin to define the global typography styles for an application. In our example, we are going to apply the bootstrap predifined styles but you can create your custom ones if you wish. 

```scss
:host {
    @include igx-typography($font-family: $bootstrap-typeface, $type-scale: $bootstrap-type-scale);
}
```
